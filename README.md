      <p>In the Pig game, two players take turns rolling a die.
          They continue rolling until they get a 1, at which point their turn
          ends and the other player gets a chance to roll. Players accumulate
          points during their turn, but if they roll a 1, they lose all the
          points they've collected in that turn. The first player to reach 100
          points wins the game.</p>
